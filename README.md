### Best practices

Please follow the following best practices when commiting to this repository.

- Use your conscience. Make life easier for the juniors, and others who contribute to this repo.
- Follow the writing structure of the present work. Consistant writing styles are easier to read.
- Be concise. Whenever you type anything, ask yourself, 'is this necessary? Is this *really* necessary?' If not, delete the relevant part.
- This is an *academic* guide. Do not include irrelevant topics such as 'Finding supermarkets in Cambridge'.
- Don't over-modularize. Question your impulse to modularize contents. A guide is often more readable if things are in the same document. See the various guides in the [teaching website](https://teaching.eng.cam.ac.uk/) for bad examples.
- Abbreviations. All abbreviations should be spelled out in `List of abbreviations.md`.
- Use only English, unless you have very good reasons to do otherwise.
- Use a Markdown linter (e.g. the 'markdownlint' VS Code extension) when writing Markdown.
