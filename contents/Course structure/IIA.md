- If the responsible person doesn’t reply to your emails, follow up cc’ing the teaching office.
- Polite and constructive emails receive better treatment.
- Always properly acknowledge others’ work to avoid plagiarism.
- The library can help find data of, e.g., air quality index in London from 2000 to 2020.

## Lent

### IIA Projects

#### General

- Two projects after Tripos in Easter.
- Approx. 80 hours per project, mostly running in parallel.
- At least 1 group project.
- 2 x 80 marks.
- Read the [Part IIA project guide](https://teaching.eng.cam.ac.uk/node/444/). It is long, but has high information density.

#### How to choose projects

- Can only choose at most 2 'popular' projects.
- Ask IIB students for their experiences with the projects. As of 2025, no feedback is available online for IIA projects.
- For the ballot, input projects in your order of preference. Do not attempt to use 'strategies'.

### IIB projects

#### Self-proposed IIB projects

- Speak to a professor and notify the teaching office before Week 3 if you are to self-propose your IIB project.
