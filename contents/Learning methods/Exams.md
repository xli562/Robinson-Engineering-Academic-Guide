# Exams

## When and where

Put the exams in your calendar as soon as the timetable is released on the [teaching website](https://teaching.eng.cam.ac.uk/). If 'exam' appears stressful, just use the course names. Include revenues and durations.

## How good do I need to be

Know how your 'final degree grade' is calculated. For example, Part IA grades account for 0% in your final grade.

Don't stress if you can't achieve everthing mentioned below. One fails the Tripos only if one does not treat the university as a place to study. However, a top 15% or 5% ranking requires hard work.

Planning is crucial. Making revision 'progress bars' on a piece of A4 paper lets you know precicely how much work needs to be done for each course, and how much you have already done. Also, it is very satisfying to fill the progress bar a little bit more at the end of each day.

Keep flexibility in mind when planning. While too much flexibility makes a loose plan, a plan is seldom realisable without redundancies.

Prerequisite: use examples papers to get a general idea of the module.

### The revision recipe

This recipe is for a 'course', or around $\frac{1}{7}$ to $\frac{1}{10}$ of a year's contents. Part IA has 4 big courses, which can be split into topics such as 'Dynamics' and 'Thermofluids'.

Time estimations are for reference.

1. Outlining (1-1.5h). Quickly list out the course contents. Flip through the handouts, focus on the 'subtitles' only. Do not try to comprehend details. This is to revive your memory of the course structure. ('Ahh, so I have learned this before. I still don't quite get it, but I have a very rough idea of what it's for.')

2. Sorting (3-4h). Sort past Tripos questions going back 5-10 years, but leaving out the most recent 2 years. Now that you know the course structure, sort the past tripos into separate exam-topics. Some contents are less frequently examined than others, while some details are never examined. Some contents are removed from the course over time, and new contents are often added in recent years. Sorting gives an idea of the required level of knowledge. Focus on the exam-topics and ignore other minutiae. It is impractical to fully understand everything in the handouts.

3. Do the easier questions open-book (6-12h). Pick apparantly easier questions from the sorted Tripos. This brushes up your Tripos skills. Open-book means no wasted time on recalling a particular piece of knowledge.

4. Make consice notes for necessary exam-topics (3-8h). It is often a good idea to not follow the handout's structure when making notes. Instead, find exam-topics that needs summarising from the bullet-points written beside each question from the last step, and only focus on these. It is a waste of time to make notes on something you are already fluent with.

5. Do last year's Tripos timed, mark, summarise (2-4.5h). This simulates exam setting and time pressure, so that you do not panic in the actual exam. This reveals your weaknesses under time pressure. Mark your answer sheet when the memory is fresh, and summarise on how you may improve (for example, "decide q. order in 10min reading'" (decide the order to do the questions, during the 10min reading time))

6. Do the harder questions, strengthen your weak spots (5-12h). Ideally this should be closed-book.

7. Do the year before last year's Tripos timed, mark, summarise (2-4.5h). After this, you have done all you can for the exams, so relax and believe in yourself, and all the hard work you've put in!

### Time allocation

Work out how many work hours are available before the exams.

Here is an example:

1. There are, say, 53 days between today and the first day of exams. Give some flexibility and consider only 50 days.

2. Roughly allocate ~30-40 hours for each course. Calculate the total time needed, say, 350 hours.

3. Estimate the time you are willing to spend on studying each week, e.g., 8-8-8-6-8-4-3 for Monday to Sunday during term, 8-8-6-8-8-3-1 for the breaks, and 6-6-6-6-6-8-3 during the exam period. Calculate the total time you wish to give, minus lectures (~1.1h each), labs (~2-4h each), supervisions (~1.3h each), EPs (~2-4h each), and academic miscellanea (~3h per week). Multiply by a safety factor of 0.8. The available time comes out as, say, 290 hours.

4. Reiterate the last 2 steps, compromising between study-time and the other parts of life, until the time required matches the time available, both coming to, say, ~330 hours. Do not delete the safety factor of 0.8, or the plan would fail within a week.

### Execute your plan

Some difficulties is unavoidable while executing any study plan. Different from a cake recipe, the revision recipe is not complete-or-fail. A decent Class I or II-1 is achievable without the last 2 steps in the recipe, as more than half of the marks in a Tripos are typically 'easy points' that can be secured with a basic, sparse understanding of course material.

#### Breaking down the plan

Make week-long plans, allocating work to morning, afternoon and evening, and adjust during execution. Realigning plans with reality is crutial to plan success. Not realigning is like walking in a set direction with eyes closed.

At the end of each day, draft a plan for tomorrow, accurate to 5 minutes. This is indicative, so that you know how much you can acomplish in a day, and not mourn over how little you have done, or have a rest tomorrow just because you have done seemingly a lot today.

It is easy to get greedy when stuffing work into a day. It is okay to not finish everything planned, just adjust the plan tomorrow to be less greedy. Don't cram until burn-out, study sustainably.

#### Efficiency is key

Roughly,

$$
\text{grade} = \text{ability} + \text{fluxuation} \\
\text{ability} = \text{work hour} \times \text{efficiency}
$$

The fluxuation is typically 5% to 10% of your grade, due to marking uncertainties such as tired markers. This you cannot control, but you can increase your ability.

In the Tripos context, efficiency is key to increasing academic aptitude. Sitting in the library is not studying, by itself. A regular pattern of 65-90 minutes' study and 15-30 minutes' break maintains efficiency.

Easy questions helps with lock-in.

Don't take the break 'until you have to take a break', but use a timer to time your study session, so that you know when the break is, and has something good to look forward to.

After working for 65-90 minutes, force yourself to put down the pen, even if in the middle of doing a question, and take a break. Be good to your brain during the breaks. Use [Forest Timer](https://www.forestapp.cc/) to stay away from your phone. Go outside to get some fresh air, or play table tennis in the Games Room. Spring is a beautiful season in Cambridge.

#### Doing the questions

Spend less than 2 times the exam-allowed time for any question, before skipping it or looking at the cribs.

After marking Tripos questions, write bullet-point summaries beside each question, for going through the questions later. A question done but not summarised is a question wasted, unless the question is trivial.

Avoid generality in bullet-point summaries. Instead of 'not careful', write 'overlooked init. cond. in q., overtimed' (I ran overtime because I overlooked the initial condition in the question).

Mark your work within 3 hours of doing the question, to keep the memory fresh.

The bullet-point question summaries are useful for making the notes on exam-topics. The notes in turn are useful to read through right before mocks and exams.

#### Making notes

Use a special mark for anything in the notes that needs to be learnt by heart.

### During the exam period

It is likely that you still have quite some work leftover, a few days before the exams. Now is not the time to panic, but to strategically maximise your grades based on the time available.

Prioritise health before everything else. Eat breakfast, wake up early to adjust to exam timetables, and have a regular timetable. Occationally students die because they have treated their body harshly for a marginal gain on Tripos grades.

Do not cram the night before an exam. This leads to panic, and panic hinders exam performance. You have already done all you can for the exam. You can make little difference studying for the extra few hours. One can hardly ever be 'fully' prepared for an exam, so this should not be your goal. Your goal is to secure every point that belongs to you, against carelessness. It is unwise to sacrifise sleep for cramming.
