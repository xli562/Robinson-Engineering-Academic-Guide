Know which courseworks count towards your final mark. Same for lectures. If you find the rest interesting, spend some but not too much time on them. Otherwise just pay in minimum effort. 

Allocation of efforts: prioritize according to marks & personal interest.

## Standard credit
- What minimum effort means: no correct answers, just attendance and some work very loosely following the guidelines. If your conscience hurts when you turn assignments in, they're most likely still going to get std credits.
- I think the purpose of std credits is to let you choose freely what you want to do and not do, and spend minimum time (~50% less time than nominal) on them, so that you have more time studying the things you're more interested in (eg doing Leetcode etc.).

Suggestion: learn LaTeX earlier on, so less pain when writing Part II reports, plus you can write prettier reports in part I.

I find that I learn coding (including LaTeX) by using them, and consulting ChatGPT, not through lectures or 'teach yourself python' jupiter notebooks. All reports in Part I are LaTeX practice oppurtunities, and the programming tasks are there for you to practice your coding skills.
